# Encrypted Notifications

> Note that although encrypted notifications do go through an event emitter deployed on chain, they should be encrypted before being sent on chain.

If your use case requires it, you can also send a private notification to your DAPP users.

## How It Works

As soon as a user opens the <Links name="SUBSCRIBER_APP" showText="subscriber app"/>, they set up their encryption keys. The public component of the asymmetric RSA key is published on chain while the private key is stored locally in the indexedDB of the browser.

Now whenever an admin uses the <Links name="ADMIN_APP" showText="admin app"/> to send a private notification, this private notification is read from the blockchain and used to encrypt the contents of the notification using [JSEncrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsencrypt). This private notification is only decryptable once the notification reaches the user's device by their own private key, making it effectively end to end encrypted, thanks to asymmetric key cryptography.

> Encrypted notifications are only allowed to be sent by the admin. Even if you have been alloted push access, you won't be allowed to send notifications if you are not the admin

## Why Private Notifications Can't Be Displayed on homescreens and sidebars?

If you have used CPNS, you would have noticed an odd thing. Title, body and images related to publicly sent (from contracts or by admin of channel) notifications show up in a notification while private notifications only show a cryptic message and you have to click on the notification to take you to the actual notification itself. This is not a desirable experience but sadly a technical limitation. Decryption is a reasonably resource intensive operation and cannot be done from inside a [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers), which is at the heart of how CPNS operates. And for the lack of a better solution, you have to click on the private notification popup to actually view them from inside the app. This limitation however, is unlikely to change soon.
