# Encrypted Notifications

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that although encrypted notifications do go through an event emitter deployed on chain, they should be encrypted before being sent on chain.
{% endhint %}

If your use case requires it, you can also send a private notification to your DAPP users.

## How It Works

As soon as a user opens the {{book.subscriberApp}}

**Encrypted notifications are only allowed to be sent by the admin. Even if you have been alloted push access, you won't be allowed to send notifications if you are not the admin**
